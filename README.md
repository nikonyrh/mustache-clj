# mustache-clj
Mustache template engine implemented in Clojure. Sure there are other implementations available such as [Clostache](https://github.com/fhd/clostache) but this was a great problem to solve while still learning the language and its best practices.

This is part of my long-term goal of porting my blog engine (statically generated HTML files + LaTeX PDFs) from PHP to Clojure. I've got the [hyphenation](https://github.com/nikonyrh/hyphenator-clj) algorithm implemented as well.
